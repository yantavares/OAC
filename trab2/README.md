# Project 2 - RISC-V simmulator

This project consists of a RISC-V simmulator, written in Python3. You should not need to install any external libraries to run it. The project was NOT MADE BY ME. All credits go to [geraldotnf.](https://github.com/geraldotnf-unb). I only made some adaptations to the code to make it run better on my machine.

Here are the instructions implemented in the simmulator:

If you have any doubts, you can read the Simulador RISC-V.pdf file (in portuguese) containing the project description in full detail.

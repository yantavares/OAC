# Project 3 - Immediate Values Extraction

This project consists of a program that extracts the immediate values from a RISC-V assembly code. The program was written in VHDL and simulated using GHDL software. You can download GHDL [here](https://github.com/ghdl/ghdl), however, it should run on any VHDL simulator.

You can see the immediate values generated on the file wave.vcd, which can be opened using GTKWave software. You can download GTKWave [here](http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/) and on the system reports, generated by the testbench file.

## How to run using GHDL and GTKWave

Using your terminal, execute the following commands:

```bash
ghdl -a ImmediateGenerator.vhdl

```

```bash

ghdl -a Testbench_ImmediateGenerator.vhdl

```

These commands will compile the files. Then, execute the following commands:

```bash
ghdl -e Testbench_ImmediateGenerator

```

```bash
ghdl -r Testbench_ImmediateGenerator --vcd=wave.vcd

```

This should generate the reports in the terminal and the wave.vcd file. To open the wave.vcd file, execute the following command:

```bash
gtkwave wave.vcd

```
